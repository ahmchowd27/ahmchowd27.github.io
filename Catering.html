                Chicken 65 is a spicy, deep-fried chicken dish that is said to have originated in Chennai, India.
                It is typically made by marinating bite-sized chicken pieces in a blend of spices, including chili powder, cumin, and turmeric, and then frying them until crispy.
                Catering services that offer Chicken 65 typically provide a variety of options to 
                suit different preferences and dietary requirements,
                such as vegetarian or non-spicy versions of the dish. They may also offer additional side dishes, 
                such as rice, naan bread, and chutneys, to complement the main dish. 90$ for full tray serve 20 people.
